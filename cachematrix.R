## makeCacheMatrix creates a special matrix which is really a list containing functions to set/get the values of the matrix and of the inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

        inv <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinv <- function(solve) inv <<- solve
        getinv <- function() inv
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinv = setinv,
             getinv = getinv)
}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinv function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        inv <- x$getinv()
        if(!is.null(inv)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(inv)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        inv <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setinv(inv)
        inv

}
